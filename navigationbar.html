	Considered as the most popular MBA entrance exam, CAT is the

	into 20 IIMs and 100+ B-schools across India. 
	Based on CAT scores, IIMs provide admission to almost 5000 candidates in various management programs. 
	Around 2 lakh aspirants appear for CAT exam every year.
	CAT offers a tough competition for admission to top B-schools accepting CAT scores. 
	Over the years, the candidates applying for CAT have been increasing year after year.

	<B><I><UL>	
	<LI>What is the structure of CAT exam?<BR/><BR/>
	</UL></I></B>

	CAT is a computer-based test of three hours duration. The exam is divided into three sections:
	<UL style="list-style-type:square;">
	<LI>    Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension (VARC)
	<LI>    Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning (DILR)
	<LI>    Quantitative Aptitude (QA)
	</UL>

	There are a total of 100 questions with minimum qualifying marks for each section.
	Apart from the sectional cut-offs, you are required to clear the overall cut off of the exam. 
	There is no specific syllabus for CAT. The syllabus is predicted on the basis of previous years’ 
	papers analysis and the topics covered. Since 2015, the pattern of the exam has remained same
	with 25 non-MCQs & 75 MCQs. <BR/><BR/>
	MCQs carry a one-third negative marking per question and there is no negative marking for non-MCQs. 
	There has been a slight change in the test pattern with the inclusion of 
	TITA (type in the answer) questions. The number of TITA questions may vary.<BR/><BR/>
	Generally, the CAT score is valid for one year except for the institutes offering deferred admission, 
	taking into account the work experience of the candidate. 
	The stated scores are a result of scaling and normalisation based on the performance of 
	candidates appearing in multiple sessions. 
	Most of the institutes base their cut offs on the basis of CAT percentiles.<BR/><BR/>
