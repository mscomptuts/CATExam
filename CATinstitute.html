	After the declaration of CAT result, IIMs and other B-schools shortlist the candidates for the 
	selection rounds – WAT (Written ability test/Essay writing), GD/CD (Group/case discussion) /Group 
	Exercise and PI (Personal Interview). 
	While IIMs and some other top B-schools declare their admission criteria and cutoff prior 
	to the result, a majority of the B-schools announce their cutoffs only after the CAT result is 
	declared.<BR/><BR/>

	The final merit list at the B-schools is based on candidates’ performance in CAT exam, 
	selection rounds and profile.</P>
